# twitterradar 2014
A small tool that keeps a database of keyword usage on Twitter, and lists URLs tweeted with those keywords.

It makes use of 140dev.com's tools to interact with Twitter's API. First draft of scripts by Ton Zijlstra (github.com/tonzyl), and redone and cleaned up by Flemming Funch (github.com/ffunch). This was all in 2014, so there's no guarantee any of this code still works.

Use for inspiration for new code, not for production
